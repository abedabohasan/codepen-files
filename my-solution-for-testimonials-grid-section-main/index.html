                      I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
                      learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
                      joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                      "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                      I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                      people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                      the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
                      enrolled shortly therafter. The next 12 weeks was the
                      best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing
                      the course, I've successfully switched careers,working as
                      a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                  "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of
                  code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
                  me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                  by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                  things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                  not diappooint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                  wait long for ssistance. The agile teame project, in
                  particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
                  level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
                  often referrd to it during interviews as an example of my
                  development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as
                  full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                  recommend!"
